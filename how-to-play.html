                The game begins with one point per hand, and the game ends when one of the player loses all points on both hands — in other words, has both hands are <q>dead</q>.
                The player with both their hands dead loses.
                A dead hand is indicated by a closed fist.
            </p>
            <p>
                During a turn, a player can either <strong>attack</strong> or <strong>split and attack</strong>.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Attacking adds all the points from the attacking hand to the attacked hand, but leaves the attacking hand unchanged. <br>
                        After an attack, if a hand exceeds four points, five points are subtracted from it. This is a crucial part of the game as this can make a hand dead. <br>
                        <em>Example</em>:
                        If one of your hands has 2 points and is attacked by a hand with 3 points, the total becomes 5.
                        Since that's over 4, you subtract 5, and your hand ends up with 0 points — or rather dead.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Splitting is only allowed if one of the hands of the current player is dead (0 points) and the other hand has 2 or 4 points. <br>
                        It helps the player to revive their dead hand by transferring half the points of the live hand to the dead hand. <br>
                        A hand with zero points can't be used to attack the opponent or be attacked by the opponent, but it is required for a split.
