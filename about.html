                Split is a turn-based, two-player hand game.
                It is a variation of the hand game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chopsticks_%28hand_game%29" rel="nofollow">Chopsticks</a>,
                which has its roots in Japan.
                There's also a variation called <q>Splits</q> (plural) commonly played in India.
                This game — Split — might be a regional variation of Splits. When I search online, I only find the game <q>Splits</q>.
                But in my area, we call it <q>Split</q> and the rules differs from the ones found on the internet.
